LibEDM
======

It a C++ library for ensemble based machine learning. It is a toolkit that provides functions covering all facets of ensemble researches, which includes algorithms of data processing, single classifier learners, ensemble methods, ensemble pruning, predicting and statistical tests, etc. This library is intended to be useful in research and is carefully designed to simply work with real-world applications.
